   <p> What is Recall? <br />
A yield generation platform that allows its users to continually and passively earn without the need for staking or spending high gas fees in order to generate yield. $CALL is a fork of $RFI with some added community features and a moderately lower supply.
Why Recall?
There are plenty of RFI forks, but we waited to launch this until the hyped pump and dump projects came and went. The goal here is longevity and innovation, this project will be sustainable over an extended period of time. And we do have plans to continually expand and build upon this ecosystem.

    <p> ✋Charity Donations
One of the best things you can do in this world is give back to people who are less fortunate than you. So we’ve created a multi-sig wallet for the community to donate directly to charities. The community wallet will hold 1500 CALL which will be used to donate to charity on a monthly basis. Even if we can only donate $100…this can be a month worth of food for someone less fortunate. <br /> <br />

Donations will happen on a monthly basis, and we will take a community vote on who we should donate to every month.
